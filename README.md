# xrxs
OSINT framework in picolisp. 

Dependencies:
- picolisp

Nice to have:
- w3m
- wget
- nmap
- iconv

Run 'pil x.l +' for interactive session with picolisp debugging at hand. 

Run 'pil examples.l +' for quick and dirty examples. 

csv.l and nmap.l can be used independently of xrxs. 

TODO:
- Web GUI 
- RPC driven action scheduling
- Integration with more scraping backends
- Remote deploy as HTML report
- Remote deploy as PHP/SQL app
